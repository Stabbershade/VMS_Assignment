# VMS_Assignment
A voting management system that enables users to vote for their favorite candidate in an election. The smart contract would handle vote casting, tallying, and result reporting.

**Project Requirements:**
Your project should meet the following requirements:

1. Use Solidity to create a smart contract that demonstrates the use of variables, functions, and events.
2. Use Remix to compile and deploy your smart contract to a test network such as Goerli or Sepolia.
3. **Optional:** Compile and deploy your smart contract using Hardhat.
4. Write a detailed README file that explains how to deploy and test your smart contract and includes a description of your project and any relevant information.
